# DATA3001 Data Science and Decisions 
This is the capstone course for the Data Science and Decisions program. The course will bring students in the three streams together to share their knowledge, expertise and training in a way that is typical of industry. Students will attend seminars by industry representatives from Data Science industries and by scientists whose research relies heavily on Data Science. Students will work on group projects related to real-world industry problems. Typical groups will be composed of students across the three different streams of the Data Science and Decisions program. The course will expose students to Data Science as it is practised in industry or by leading research groups in academia.

The entire data science iterative workflow of your project can be briefly described as follows:
- Step 1: choosing and understanding of a problem to solve;
- Step 2: identifying one or several appropriate raw data sets;
- Step 3: wrangling, exploring and cleaning the data at hand;
- Step 4: planning the project, the roles in the team and the tasks to perform;
- Step 5: assessing the state of the art in the domain by conducting a literature review;
- Step 6: selecting the appropriate statistical and machine learning techniques and computing tools;
- Step 7: modelling, explaining, inferring and predicting in order to add value;
- Step 8: creating visualisations that will give better insight;
- Step 9: reporting, implementing and deploying your findings.
